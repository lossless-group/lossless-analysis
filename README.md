# Lossless Analysis
We support various clients in strategy and planning, which requires analysis and data visualization. Given the dependencies involved, this is now it's own repository. All client data is protected but the code is "Lost in Public"

## Current Work
We are helping a scale-up venture in an emerging market to prepare to raise their first round of capital. Bootstrapped and acheiving meaningful scale over a ten year period, we are performing historical financial and KPI analysis to inform their strategy and planning.

(We are also creating data visualizations that can help hone their pitch, as well as generating the pitch materials.)
